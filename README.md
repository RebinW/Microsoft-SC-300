# Project overview
This repository documents my work with Microsoft Entra ID while preparing for the SC300 certification. The goal is to move beyond theory and actually implement identity and access management controls in my own tenant, while documenting each step and decision.

I use the official Microsoft Learn material and labs as the technical foundation. Instead of treating the labs as isolated exercises, I document the configurations, explain why they matter, and use them to build practical experience.

**Relationship to my ISO 27001 project**

This project also supports a seperate ISO 27001 implementation project I am actively working on.

In the ISO project, I identify risks related to identity and access management. The work in this repository shows how these risks can be addressed in practice through real configurations in Microsoft Entra ID.

Screenshots and documentation from these labs will later be used as operational evidence when documenting Annex A control implementation and monitoring activities.

**Scope**

The focus here is identity and access management. The work includes:
- role and permission management
- privileged access protection
- conditional access configuration
- identity governance features
- external identities and supplier access
- authentication and monitoring

The goal is to understand how identity controls are implemented, not only how they are described in theory.

**Outcome**

This repository/ project shows how I approch identity security from both a technical and governance perspective, and how hands on configuration work can support risk reduction and control implementation.

*This repository is continuously updated as new labs, configurations, and identity controls are implemented.*
