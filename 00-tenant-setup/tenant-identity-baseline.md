**Licensing**

*License type purchased:*
- Microsoft 365 E5 trial license
  - Includes 25 licenses to assign to users

 *Reason for choosing it:*
 - The reason I chosee to sign up for Microsoft E5 is mainly because Entra ID P2 is included
  - Entra ID P2: Comes with all the advanced IAM capabilities that are nessesary for the upcoming labs

*Capabilities unlocked:*

Entra ID P2 capabilities:
- Identity protection
- Privileged Identity Management
- Access Reviews
- Entitlement Management

For my project I am mainly interested in understanding the difference between Entra ID Free, Entra ID P1 and Entra ID P2 licenses. I found this official Microsoft 365 plan comparison that gives an good overview of the differenct products and the capabilities included en each:
