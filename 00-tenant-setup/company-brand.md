# Configuring the company brand

The official Microsoft SC300 labs do not include this project. I chose to do this anyway because branding affects:
- Sign-in experience
- User trust
- Phishing resistance
- Guest onboarding

I have chosen to not document each step in this lab since it is quite straight foward and there are many ways to customize the layout. I will still document the outcome and highlight the main features I chose to customize including: 
- Favicon
- Background image
- Banner-logo
- Show self-service password reset
